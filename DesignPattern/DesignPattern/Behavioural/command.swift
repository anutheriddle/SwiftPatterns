 👫 Command
 ----------
 The command pattern is used to express a request, including the call to be made and all of its required parameters, in a command object. The command may then be executed immediately or held for later use.
 ### Example:
 */
protocol DoorCommand {
    func execute() -> String
}

class OpenCommand : DoorCommand {
    let doors:String
    
    required init(doors: String) {
        self.doors = doors
    }
    
    func execute() -> String {
        return "Opened \(doors)"
    }
}

class CloseCommand : DoorCommand {
    let doors:String
    
    required init(doors: String) {
        self.doors = doors
    }
    
    func execute() -> String {
        return "Closed \(doors)"
    }
}

class HAL9000DoorsOperations {
    let openCommand: DoorCommand
    let closeCommand: DoorCommand
    
    init(doors: String) {
        self.openCommand = OpenCommand(doors:doors)
        self.closeCommand = CloseCommand(doors:doors)
    }
    
    func close() -> String {
        return closeCommand.execute()
    }
    
    func open() -> String {
        return openCommand.execute()
    }
}
